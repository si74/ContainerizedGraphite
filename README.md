# ContainerizedGraphite
graphite + carbon + whisper

Note:
I got lazy and decided to use this docker image for the actual graphite + paraphernalia part:
[Docker-Graphite](https://github.com/nickstenning/docker-graphite)

This repository, however, contains a docker-compose file for collectd and statsd. To use the docker-compose file,
simply run `docker-compose up`.
